# Maximize K-Distinct Elements in Sliding Window
# Given an array of integers `nums` and two integers `k` and `window_size`,
# find the maximum number of distinct elements that can be present in any
# subarray (sliding window) of size `window_size`. If no window of the
# specified size exists, return 0.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,4,2,3], k = 3, window_size = 4
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# Window [1,2,1,3] has distinct elements {1,2,3} (count: 3)
# Window [2,1,3,4] has distinct elements {1,2,3,4} (count: 4) -> This example needs correction in prompt, K is not used. The problem should be "Maximize Distinct Elements in Sliding Window"
# Let's rephrase: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `window_size`,
# find the maximum number of distinct elements that can be present in any
# subarray (sliding window) of size `window_size`. If no window of the
# specified size exists, return 0.
#
# Example 1 (Revised):
# Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,4,2,3], window_size = 4
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# Window [1,2,1,3] has distinct elements {1,2,3} (count: 3)
# Window [2,1,3,4] has distinct elements {1,2,3,4} (count: 4)
# Window [1,3,4,2] has distinct elements {1,2,3,4} (count: 4)
# Window [3,4,2,3] has distinct elements {2,3,4} (count: 3)
# The maximum is 4.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [5,5,5,5,5], window_size = 3
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# Window [5,5,5] has distinct elements {5} (count: 1)
# The maximum is 1.
#
# Example 3:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], window_size = 1
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# Window [1] has distinct elements {1} (count: 1)
# Window [2] has distinct elements {2} (count: 1)
# ...
# The maximum is 1.
#
# Example 4:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3], window_size = 5
# Output: 0
# Explanation: No window of size 5 exists.
